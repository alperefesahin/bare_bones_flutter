## Features

- **Localization**: Supports multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **Authentication Pages**: Includes Sign In and Sign Up pages with text form fields validated using regular expressions.
- **Navigation**: Utilizes `go_router` for navigation and `shell_route` for nested routing.
- **Main Branch**: No state management, providing the most general case. No ViewModel since there is no functionality yet.
- **Firebase Integration (firebase-riverpod branch)**:
  - Functional Sign In, Sign Out, and Sign Up using Firebase.
  - Built on top of the main branch's features.
  - Incorporates `Riverpod` for state management.

## Branches

- **main**: Contains the basic template with the features listed above. No state management or ViewModel.
- **firebase-riverpod**: Builds on the main branch with Firebase integration (using Riverpod) and additional functionalities for user authentication.
